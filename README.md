Direflow is an upgrade and enhancement of the project: [create-react-web-component](https://create-react-web-component.com/)

## Get started

You can get started using direflow, but this project is still under development.
You are adviced to instead use [create-react-web-component](https://create-react-web-component.com/).

However, if you want to try out direflow, you can get started by installing the cli:
```console
npm i -g direflow-cli
```

Create a new Web Component using
```console
direflow create -c
```
(this is the equivalent of `npx create-react-web-component`)
